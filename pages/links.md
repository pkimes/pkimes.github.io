Some favorite online resources.

### Course Materials  

* **MITx 7.00x**: a clear and concise introduction to the fundamentals of molecular biology taught by an amazing instructor Eric Lander, who also happens to be an amazing researcher, and the head of the Harvard-MIT Broad Institute. (_currently not available online._)
* [**Harvard CS109**][CS109]: an introduction to "Data Science" co-taught by complimentary instructors in statistics and CS. The IPython notebooks which are available for both labs and homeworks (with solutions!) for current and past offerings of the course are invaluable.
* [**Harvard CS171**][CS171]: similar in structure to CS 109, but focused on the principles and tools for (yes) data visualization, and yes, they cover D3.js.
* [**Maryland INFM603**][INFM]: an introductory course intended for masters students in their depratment covering HTML, Javascript, PHP basics. Homework solutions are not available.


### Coding Resources  

* [**Jeff Leek's R package guide**][Leek-Rguide]: a great/short/amazing guide from the Leek Lab that outlines first steps in putting together an `R` package.
* [**Hadley Wickham's R package guide**][Hadley-Rguide]: my go-to resource when I start feeling overwhelmed about S4 objects and proper documentation.
* [**Karl Broman's Tutorials**][Broman-tutorials]: all of them, but especially the [**GitHub tutorial**][Broman-github] for maintaining coding projects and [**hipsteR**][Broman-hipsteR] to get you caught up on what's "cool" in `R` right now.


### Lists  

* [**Jeff Leek's recommended reading**][Leek-list]: a great reading list for bio/statistics Ph.D. students (and others) interested in statistical genetics and genomics.
