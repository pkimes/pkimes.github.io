In my current research, I primarily work on machine learning problems, e.g. __classification__
and __clustering__, with applications to __genomics__. My research has ranged from statistical theory
for large-margin classification to the development of methods for assessing the statistical
significance of clusters, and for clustering RNA-seq samples using per-base expression.  

For some of my more applied work, I've written a few accompanying __R packages__. All are available either through __Bioconductor__ or
__GitHub__. For more details on the usage of each, see the corresponding vignette (Bioconductor) or `README` pages (GitHub). If anything
isn't working as described (or you have any suggestions) don't hesitate to [let me know](aboutme.html)! I'm pretty good with email.

* [__sigclust2__][sigclust2]: Assessing the statistical significance in hierarchical clustering.
* [__spliceclust__][spliceclust]: Visualization/exploratory analysis of splicing across RNA-seq samples.

For more details on the methods, see the appropriate references from my [publications](publications.html).
