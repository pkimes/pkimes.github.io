I am currently a Principal Scientist at [Roche Sequencing][roche] in Pleasanton, CA working on developing NGS-based molecular diagnostics.  

I received my PhD in [Statistics][] at [The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)][unc], where my time was split between the Department of Statistics and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. My dissertation work encompassed statistical machine learning problems motivated by questions arising from genomics data. As a member of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, I also contributed to the analysis of RNA-seq data for projects associated with [the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)][TCGA]. Before moving to the South, I was a proud Sagehen at [Pomona College][pomona] in Claremont, CA.
