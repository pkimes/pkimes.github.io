I am currently a **bioinformatician** [biology + data] at [Roche Sequencing][roche] in Pleasanton, CA building computational pipelines for DNA-sequencing-based molecular diagnostics.  

Before moving to the Bay Area, I completed my PhD in [Statistics][] at the [University of North Carolina][unc], where my time was split between the Department of Statistics and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. My dissertation work involved **machine learning, genomics, and [R][]**. As a member of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, I also contributed analyses to [The Cancer Genome Atlas][TCGA]. Before graduate school, I studied math at [Pomona College][pomona].
